### Work Experience
#### Data Science Intern @ Oshkosh Corporation
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Python on 6 Supplier tables containing 25,000+ claims and 1000+ unique vehicle parts, identifying failure correlations and key causal components.
* Engineered 2 CatBoost regression models to forecast repair costs and repair times for failed vehicle components, achieving 80% accuracy on test sets through Mean Absolute Error, R2, and SHAP values analysis.
* Optimized predictive modelsâ€™ accuracies by 10% through Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning and feature engineering, validated using Root Mean Squared Error analysis.

### Work Experience
#### Data Science Intern @ Oshkosh Corporation (_September 2024 - Present_)**
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Python on 6 Supplier tables containing 25,000+ claims and 1000+ unique vehicle parts, identifying failure correlations and key causal components.
* Engineered 2 CatBoost regression models to forecast repair costs and repair times for failed vehicle components, achieving 80% accuracy on test sets through Mean Absolute Error, R<sup>2</sup>, and SHAP values analysis.
* Optimized predictive models’ accuracies by 10% through Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning and feature engineering, validated using Root Mean Squared Error analysis.

#### Data Business Analyst Intern @ Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds (_May 2024 - August 2024_)**
* Analyzed user behavior patterns via Google Analytics, uncovering a 30% increase in website traffic, a 20% uptick in the Click-Through Rates, and increased user engagement on the new Retirement Separation webpage.
* Created 2 Tableau dashboards with 5 visualizations each, leveraging customer interaction data to identify trends in retirement planning among Wisconsin state employees for stakeholder insights.
* Designed 25 SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze contributions and health benefits of 268,000+ employees and 2,800+ employers, creating a comprehensive Employer Persona dataset.

#### Data Analyst Intern @ Northwestern University (MAPSCorps) (_June 2023 - August 2023_)**
* Standardized and integrated data from 1,255 Chicago business assets and 17 public datasets using R and Python, uncovering socio-economic disparities in post-COVID-19 recovery for underserved communities.
* Identified correlations among 20+ socio-economic metrics via statistical modeling and EDA in R, delivering actionable recommendations to community leaders.
* Constructed 2 Power BI dashboards, each featuring 6 distribution graphs, and developed 11 separate mapping error reports to enhance the Data Science team’s decision-making and improve data comprehension for stakeholders.

### Projects

</p>
Successfully applied deep learning techniques to improve the detection and classification of skin cancers, achieving notable results in diagnosing melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Using a dataset of 10,015 dermoscopic images, models like ANN, CNN, and VGG-16 were trained and evaluated, with the CNN model achieving the highest performance—77% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.71. By demonstrating significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, this project highlights the potential of deep learning models to provide reliable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tools for early skin cancer detection, paving the way for better clinical outcomes and timely treatments.

#### Covid-19 Health Impact Data Analysis

</p>
This project involved advanced data analysis and visualization to uncover key insights into COVID-19 health trends. I implemented and executed 32 optimized SQL queries, utilizing joins, sub-queries, and nested queries to extract, transform, and load over 70,000 data points, improving data manipulation efficiency by 25%. Additionally, I designed an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring geographical layouts and time-series graphs, enabling the identification of critical patterns behind regional spikes in infection rates. This work demonstrates proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools to drive actionable insights from complex datasets.
